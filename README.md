## Problem: SQLQuery - Coding Assignment

The purpose of this Repo is about solving a coding Challeng.
We are trying to read from a Json file and have to Parse the Json Data
After Parsing the Data we have to conduct an SQL Query to either insert or output the data into any database.

To achieve this feature we did use the Java Jackson dependency that we will need to import first as well as provide a valid json file.
we will need a database available and running so we can connect to it and test the feature.

In this Repo the samples Code did provide the Logic of How we can implement such problem.
